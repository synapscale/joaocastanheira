		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Next.js Middleware Authentication Token Verification",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the middleware token verification into specific implementation steps: JWT token extraction from multiple sources, jose library integration for secure decoding, token validation logic, error handling and fallback mechanisms, route-specific middleware configuration, and performance optimization with timing controls.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to critical authentication middleware requiring multiple token sources, security considerations, performance requirements (<50ms), and integration with jose library. The task involves complex JWT handling, race condition prevention, and robust error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Robust Token Synchronization System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive subtasks for multi-layer token storage implementation: TokenManager class development, localStorage primary storage setup, httpOnly cookie secondary storage, in-memory caching system, cross-tab synchronization with storage events, automatic token refresh mechanism, and js-cookie library integration.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity involving multiple storage mechanisms, cross-tab synchronization, automatic refresh logic, and complex state management. Requires deep understanding of browser storage APIs, security considerations, and performance optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance AuthContext and Login Flow Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the AuthContext enhancement into focused subtasks: AuthContext initialization and token verification on app load, useLogin hook implementation with error handling, LoginForm component integration with timing delays, TypeScript interface definitions, AuthProvider useEffect implementation for token restoration, and logout functionality with complete token cleanup.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to React context management, state synchronization, race condition handling, and TypeScript integration. Requires careful coordination between multiple React components and hooks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Update ApiService for Backend Authentication Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the ApiService enhancement into specific implementation areas: JWT authentication response handling and normalization, axios interceptor configuration for automatic token attachment, error handling for authentication failures with specific error codes, automatic token refresh on 401 responses, and CORS configuration with credential support.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving HTTP client configuration, response normalization, interceptor patterns, and backend integration. Requires understanding of axios library, HTTP authentication patterns, and error handling strategies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Chat API Endpoint Updates",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the chat API updates into specific implementation components: endpoint migration to new conversation/message structure, TypeScript interface updates for new response formats, streaming support implementation using SSE or WebSocket, ChatContext and useChatHook updates, error handling for chat operations, and message queuing for offline scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to API migration, real-time communication implementation, multiple protocol support (SSE/WebSocket), and offline functionality. Requires understanding of streaming protocols and chat system architecture."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the error handling system into comprehensive components: centralized error handling system with custom error classes, React Error Boundary implementation, toast notification system integration, error recovery mechanisms with automatic retry logic, logging system implementation with winston, error tracking integration points, and circuit breaker pattern implementation for API resilience.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving system-wide error handling architecture, multiple recovery mechanisms, logging infrastructure, and resilience patterns. Requires deep understanding of error handling strategies and monitoring systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Performance Optimization and Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize performance optimization into targeted improvement areas: authentication performance optimization with caching and lazy loading, React component optimization using memo and useMemo, service worker implementation for offline caching, performance monitoring setup with web-vitals, code splitting implementation for authentication modules, and API optimization with request deduplication and caching strategies.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to performance requirements (<50ms), multiple optimization techniques, monitoring implementation, and advanced React patterns. Requires expertise in performance optimization, caching strategies, and monitoring tools."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Testing and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the testing and documentation effort into comprehensive coverage areas: comprehensive test suite implementation with Jest and React Testing Library, E2E testing setup with Playwright, API contract testing implementation, documentation generation with TypeDoc and Storybook, and CI/CD integration with automated testing and coverage reporting.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving multiple testing frameworks, documentation tools, and CI/CD integration. While conceptually straightforward, requires extensive setup and comprehensive coverage across different testing types."
